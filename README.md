# Toxic Comment Classification Model

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify online comments based on their toxicity. 
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled comments with varying levels of toxicity, including categories like toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity_hate.  
The goal is to automatically identify and filter out harmful or inappropriate online content.

The project involved processing text data by using text-vectorization and training a Deep Neural Network with layers such as: Dense, Bidirectional and Embedding layers to predict the classes to categorize new comments.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
